SEB brings the live game's **sound banks** and the **code that plays them** into SPT. Guns, ambience and room acoustics sound like EFT 1.0.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom weapons (WTT-Armory…) keep their own sounds. Weapons that WTT-ContentBackport replaces (M4A1, HK416, PKM…) get the live sounds.

### How a shot is played

    C -- yes --> D[One clip<br/>per bullet]
    C -- no --> E[Full single shot<br/>with tail]
    D --> F[Timed on the<br/>audio clock]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Distance filters,<br/>HRTF, occlusion]
    G --> H[Live mixer]
```

## Acoustics per map

Tarkov doesn't let sound pass through walls. Each map is cut into **rooms** (a corridor, a flat, a stairwell, a courtyard). Rooms are joined by **openings**: doors, windows, stairs.

When something happens in another room, the game finds the easiest way through those openings. The longer and more closed the way, the more muffled the sound.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Shot in a flat] -->|door| B[Stairwell]
    B -->|window| C[Courtyard]
    C --> D((You))
    A -.->|wall: blocked| D
```

EFT 1.0 recomputed these ways for every map. SEB adapts them to SPT's maps.

**What it brings to the game:**

- Sounds that were fully muffled now **come through doors and stairs**.
- Shorter ways mean **clearer sounds** from nearby rooms.
- Fewer detours mean **a more believable layout** of what you hear.

Covered maps: Customs, Woods, Reserve, Shoreline, Interchange, Lighthouse, Ground Zero, Streets of Tarkov, The Lab. Factory and Labyrinth already match EFT 1.0.

If an SPT update changes a map, SEB falls back to SPT's own routes for it.

## Settings (F12)

Open the Configuration Manager with **F12**, section **Volume**. Changes apply immediately.

3. Start the server, then the game.

Requires SPT 4.1.x. About 1.4 GB of audio.
